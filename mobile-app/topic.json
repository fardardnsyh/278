Whether you're counting objects, solving problems, or working with numbers, understanding addition and subtraction is essential. In this article, we will provide a simple and easy-to-understand guide to help students master addition and subtraction.</p><h2 style='color: black;'>Addition</h2><p style='color: darkgray;'>Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total. The result of addition is called the sum.</p><p style='font-size: 18px; font-weight: 300;'>Example: <span style='font-size: 24px;'>2 + 3 = 5</span></p><h3 style='color: black;'>Basic Addition</h3><p style='color: darkgray;'>To perform basic addition, you simply add the numbers together. For example, 2 + 3 = 5.</p><h3 style='color: black;'>Properties of Addition</h3><p style='color: darkgray;'>Addition has several properties, such as commutativity, associativity, and identity property. These properties make addition easier to work with and help in solving mathematical problems.</p><h2 style='color: black;'>Subtraction</h2><p style='color: darkgray;'>Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another to find the difference between them. The result of subtraction is called the difference.</p><p style='font-size: 18px; font-weight: 300;'>Example: <span style='font-size: 24px;'>5 - 3 = 2</span></p><h3 style='color: black;'>Basic Subtraction</h3><p style='color: darkgray;'>To perform basic subtraction, you subtract one number from another. For example, 5 - 3 = 2.</p><h3 style='color: black;'>Properties of Subtraction</h3><p style='color: darkgray;'>Subtraction also has properties similar to addition, such as commutativity, but it lacks the associative property. Understanding these properties helps in solving subtraction problems efficiently.</p>"
